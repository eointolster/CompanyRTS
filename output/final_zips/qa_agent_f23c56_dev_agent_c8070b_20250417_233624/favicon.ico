I cannot directly create a binary .ico file in this format. The favicon.ico file is a binary image file that contains one or more small icons. Instead, I can provide guidance on how to generate one:

For your RotationBalls project, you need to:

1. Create a square image (32x32 pixels is standard, though 16x16, 48x48, and 64x64 are also commonly included)
2. Design an icon that represents rotating balls (perhaps a simple circular shape with motion lines)
3. Use an online favicon generator like favicon.io, realfavicongenerator.net, or favicon-generator.org
4. Upload your image to convert it to .ico format
5. Save the resulting favicon.ico file in your project's root directory
6. Reference it in your HTML with: <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

Alternatively, you could use a modern approach with multiple formats:
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
<link rel="icon" href="icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">
